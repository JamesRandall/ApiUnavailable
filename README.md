# Api Unavailable

Simple Owin and ASP.Net based website that will return a 503 Service Unavailable message on any and all requests including those made using the CORS protocol. It's therefore quite handy when doing upgrades for RESTful APIs that service JavaScript clients and allows the 503 code to pass through to error handling and an appropriate message displayed.
